# Modified DuckDuckGo Android

I preferred a slight rearrangement of the UI in the DuckDuckGo browser, so I've moved some things around.

The back button and change tab button are now accessible without having to go into the popup menu.

The fire button has been moved out of the main menu and into the popup menu.
